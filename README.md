# Employeeasy

Employeeasy is a new web-app which streamlines managing of your employees, using a minimal UI that focuses on functionality and ease of use. Built with individual managers in mind, this app is a tool that lets you:

- Add your team to it
- View all your employees in one place
- Manage employees' vacation
- Manage team expenses and link them to the corresponding employee

Using the built-in dashboard, take a glance at your weekly overview, including your daily meetings and your average statistics.

## Live Walkthrough

## Demo

If you want to give the app a go, a demo version can be found on [employeeasy.netlify.com](employeeasy.netlify.com). If you want to see it in action with some mock data (that is grabbed from the employeeasy server, which you can find [here](https://github.com/george-roussos/employeeasy-server), you can use the credentials:

- username: `malinholmgren`
- password: `12345`

And you can browse through collections. You can also sign up for a new account. After signing up, use the same credentials to log into the environment. However, note that since the account will be new, you will have to create entries of employees, vacation etc. yourself.

## Local Run

Clone this repo and run `npm i`. The frontend will work, but for security reasons I have not included the credentials to connect to the MongoDB instance, so you will have to contact me and I will gladly work it out for you.

## Tech Stack

Employeeasy is written on React, JS, HTML5 and CSS3.
